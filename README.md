# Advent of Code

Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

## About This Repository

This repository is an experiment in AI-assisted automation using Claude Code. The goal is to explore how AI can autonomously solve programming challenges, manage workflows, and commit solutions - not to compete on leaderboards or circumvent the learning experience that Advent of Code provides.

**Timeline:** AI automation was added in 2025. Solutions committed before 2025 were solved manually. Solutions from 2025 onwards (regardless of which AoC event year they're for) are AI-assisted.

**Key Points:**
- **Educational Purpose**: This is a technical exploration of AI capabilities, GitHub Actions automation, and agent-based programming
- **Not for Competition**: No leaderboard participation - runs are scheduled well after puzzle release (12:00 AM EST)
- **Learning Tool**: Understanding how to work *with* AI on complex tasks is a valuable skill
- **Open Source**: The entire workflow and prompts are public, making this a learning resource for others interested in AI automation

If you're new to Advent of Code, I strongly encourage you to solve puzzles yourself first - the learning experience is invaluable and far more rewarding than seeing AI-generated solutions.
