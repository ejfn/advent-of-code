# Advent of Code

Solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

## A Note About AI

**On Advent of Code's Stance**: The [AoC creator discourages AI usage](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about) for solving puzzles. That's absolutely valid - using AI to solve puzzles defeats the purpose of learning algorithmic problem-solving.

**This Repository's Purpose**: This isn't about learning algorithms; it's about learning to work effectively with AI automation tools, which is itself a valuable skill. This repository is an experiment in AI-assisted automation using Claude Code, exploring how AI can autonomously solve programming challenges, manage workflows, and commit solutions. It's a technical exploration of AI capabilities, GitHub Actions automation, and agent-based programming - not a competition or a shortcut to bypass learning.

**Timeline**: AI automation was added in 2025. Solutions committed before 2025 were solved manually. Solutions from 2025 onwards (regardless of which AoC event year they're for) are AI-assisted.

**Transparency**: The entire workflow and prompts are public, making this a learning resource for others interested in AI automation. There is no leaderboard competition involved.

If you're new to Advent of Code, I strongly encourage you to solve puzzles yourself first - the learning experience is invaluable and far more rewarding than seeing AI-generated solutions.
